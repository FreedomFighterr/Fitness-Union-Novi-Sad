### Minimum set of pages (sections) within the project:
  
    a) Home page of the application - Displays the list of fitness centers that exist on the platform  
  
    b) Login and registration sections - Should be hidden initially. They are displayed by clicking on the corresponding HTML elements (they    need to be implemented as "pop-up" sections available on all pages, not as separate pages).
    
    c) Individual Fitness Center Pages - Displays individual fitness center information  
  
    d) Individual Training Details Page - Displays individual training information within the selected fitness center  
  
    e) Edit Fitness Center Details Page - A page with a form to edit individual fitness center details. It is necessary that the form be filled with existing data.  
  
    f) Admin page for managing users and fitness centers - Displays a list of all users in the system. Functionality of deleting fitness centers and deactivating users  
  
    g) Individual User Details Page – Displays information about an individual user, like a user's profile page  
  
    h) Edit Individual User Details Page – A page with a form to edit individual user details. It is necessary that the form be filled with existing data.  

    For all the mentioned pages, it is necessary to comply with the principles of responsive design during implementation, i.e. to ensure that they look correct on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
## HOMEWORK PT.2
### It is necessary to implement all JavaScript functionalities defined by the project specification.
    a) All data on list pages (home page showing all fitness centers and admin page showing all users) needs to be loaded dynamically from Firebase database.  
  
    b) For all actions related to deleting or deactivating system entities, create dialogs through which users will be asked to confirm their action.  
  
    c) Implement showing and hiding login and registration sections. Implement the functionality of logging in to the system (Login) based on user data provided from Firebase. Login and registration should be available on all pages.  
  
    d) On the pages for changes of fitness centers and users, it is necessary that the forms are initially filled with current data.  
  
    e) Forms for changes of all entities, as well as actions for deletion, do not need to be functional, it is enough to validate the data and in some way inform the user whether he has successfully entered the required data.  
  
    f) Pay attention to Responsive web design!
